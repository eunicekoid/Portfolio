## Analyzing and Forecasting Covid-19 Transmission in India Using Machine Learning

(Completed November 2020)

The Covid-19 virus spreads respiratorily as people come in contact with one another. Preliminary evidence in the United States (as of November 2020) shows that environmental factors such as forest density and air quality may have an impact on the spread and mortality rate of Covid-19 ([Costello, 2020](https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2020/07/17/why-air-pollution-is-linked-to-severe-cases-of-covid-19/)).
- Repiratory and cardiovascular complications are impacted by air quality ([Forouzanfar et al., 2017](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32366-8/fulltext#articleInformation)).
- Air quality depends on the capacity of trees to remove air pollutants and eliminate volatile organic compounds that contribute to ozone and PM2.5 formation ([Chameides et al.,1988](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.3420404)). 
- India has high air pollution from urbanization and industry, particularly from the energy sector which might worsen the transmission of Covid-19 ([Contreras and Ferri, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705091630758X)). 

This analysis investigates the relationship between forest coverage and air quality with the number of Covid-19 cases in India. It aims to answer the following question: <em>Does high forest coverage slow the spread of Covid-19 and minimize cases in India due to better air quality?</em>

The data used in this analysis is from open source resources:
- AnuragAnalog. (2020, June 19). Geodata-of-India [Dataset](https://github.com/AnuragAnalog/Geodata-of-India)
- Development Data Lab. (2020, April 14). Development Data Lab [Dataset](http://www.devdatalab.org/covid)
- Socioeconomic High-resolution Rural-Urban Geographic Platform


### Approach
1. Conduct exploratory data analysis by each Indian state, examining the following three main variable groups: air quality, health and demographic, and Covid-19 cases. 
    - Air quality variables are total area of forest, the forest cover value, and mean pollution. 
    - Health and demographic variables are slum, work and total population, urban share, population density and number of doctors and hospitals. 
    - Covid-19 variables are total cases and deaths. 

2. Apply spatial visualization, regression, and clustering algorithms to identify patterns and relationships between variables. 

#### Data Collection and Interrogation

Covid-19 data
- Data from January 30 to April 26, 2020 from the Data Development Lab India (DLL India). Files used: covid_cases_deaths_district.csv, covid_deaths_recoveries.csv, and covid_infected_deaths.csv 
- The following operations were done: 
    - Renamed the state names according to the state name in shapefile
    - Merged Covid_cases_death_districts with death_recoveries by state_id
    - Dropped duplicates
    - Recovered number of Covid-19 patients by summing up grouped data by state

Health and demographics data
- The files titled pc11_demographics.csv and health_district_pc11.csv are from DLL India and the Socioeconomic High-resolution Rural-Urban Geographic Platform (SHRUG) (2020). The demographics data is from the 2011 population census; the relevant variables are StateID, UrbanShare, PopDens, StateName, SlumPop, TotPop, WorkPopGeo. 

Air quality and forest data
- The mean pollution data (ddl_pollution_sedac_lgd.csv) is from DLL India and includes data on mean pollution per state. The state names were renamed according to the state name in shapefile, merging on state ID.
- Forest data (Indian_forest.csv and shrug_ec13_state_key.csv) is from the SHRUG platform. This consists of a calculation of forest coverage by pixel density of each state photographed by satellites between 2000 and 2014. 2014 forest data was used because it is the most recent data available; the relevant variables are the total amount of forest coverage and the maximum value of forest cover (percent) in each district. This data was reformatted and cleaned by merging and averaging the data by state. States were renamed according to the state names in the shapefile and merged with the shapefile.

Final dataframe
- The aforementioned cleaned data along with the Indian shapefile, were saved as the final dataframe. The shape file was retrieved from Github user AnuragAnalog (2020) and contains the boundaries of India. 
- The variables of interest are: Total number of hospitals, Total number of doctors, urban share, population density, slum population, total population, working population, mean pollution, forest data from 2000 until 2014, ec13_state_id, Covid-19 deaths and cases and average.
