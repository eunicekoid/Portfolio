## Analyzing and Forecasting Covid-19 Transmission in India Using Machine Learning

(Completed November 2020)

The Covid-19 virus spreads respiratorily as people come in contact with one another. Preliminary evidence in the United States (as of November 2020) shows that environmental factors such as forest density and air quality may have an impact on the spread and mortality rate of Covid-19 ([Costello, 2020](https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2020/07/17/why-air-pollution-is-linked-to-severe-cases-of-covid-19/)).
- Repiratory and cardiovascular complications are impacted by air quality ([Forouzanfar et al., 2017](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32366-8/fulltext#articleInformation)).
- Air quality depends on the capacity of trees to remove air pollutants and eliminate volatile organic compounds that contribute to ozone and PM2.5 formation ([Chameides et al.,1988](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.3420404)). 
- India has high air pollution from urbanization and industry, particularly from the energy sector which might worsen the transmission of Covid-19 ([Contreras and Ferri, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187705091630758X)). 

This analysis investigates the relationship between forest coverage and air quality with the number of Covid-19 cases in India. It aims to answer the following question: <em>Does high forest coverage slow the spread of Covid-19 and minimize cases in India due to better air quality?</em>
