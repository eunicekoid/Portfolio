### Agent-based Modeling for Data-driven Enforcement: Combining Empirical Data with Behavioral Theory for Scenario-based Analysis of Inspections

Governmental inspection agencies typically use historical inspection data to dervice risk-based policies for the enforcement of laws and regulation. However, pure data-based policies have serious drawbacks, namely a lack of explainability and generalizability. 
<br><br>
In this project, I create a new model-based approach to inspection policies called a _phenomenological agent-based model_ that enhances a pure data-based model with behavioral theories. I applied the model to the Dutch inland shipping sector to show how the model can address known challenges of purely data-driven approaches and lead to more generalizable models.
