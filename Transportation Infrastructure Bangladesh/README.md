## Simulating Infrastructure Vulnerabilities in Banglesh to Improve the Resilience of the Transportation Network

Infrastructure bottlenecks are one of the top inhibitors of economic growth in Bangladesh ([PSF, 2020](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=Bangladesh-Architectural-Construction-and-Engineering-Services). The South Asian country regularly faces natural disasters like earthquakes, river flooding, and cyclones, placing excessive stress on its infrastructure. Enormous investment is required to bring the railways, roads, and waterways up to the standard needed to facilitate the growing population of Bangladesh.

**Research Questions:**

1. Within Bangladesh's multimodal transportation network, what are the most critical infrastructure elements?
2. Which infrastructure elements contribute the most to the vulnerability of the transportation network when exposed to hazards?
3. What interventions can be implemented to enhance the resilience of the transportation network?
